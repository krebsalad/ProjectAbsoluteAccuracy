0.6.0 (2018-07-09)
------------------
* install our new tools
* add depend on visualization_msgs
* Merge pull request `#63 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/63>`_ from mikeferguson/checkerboards_that_work
  Make checkerboards actually generic
* Merge pull request `#62 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/62>`_ from mikeferguson/chain_manager_state_fix
  make sure we get valid joint_states
* make sure we get valid joint_states
  * invalid old state, wait for new message
  * fixes `#61 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/61>`_
* Merge pull request `#59 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/59>`_ from saurabhbansal90/master
  Update led_finder.cpp
* Update led_finder.cpp
* additional tests on camera_info
* fix build in kinetic
* remove entirely unused data functions header
* fix corrupted license file
* additional warning not previously flagged
* buildfarm is really picky, fix another signed comparison
* fix signed comparison warning in tests
* add tool to visualize bagfile
* break out load_bag function for reuse
* towards working checkerboards
  * unhack the checkerboard finder, so that points are in x/y only
  * add free_frames_initial_values parameter for setting initial
  offset of checkerboard frame
* Merge pull request `#52 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/52>`_ from mikeferguson/melodic-backport
  backport changes from melodic-devel branch
* fix OutrageousError
  This has apparently NEVER worked. The name that was being
  provided was the error block name, not the name of the
  parameter to limit.
* add to_rpy tool
  The YAML file output by calibration represents angles in
  the internal axis-magnitude notation. RPY tends to be
  easier for people to understand and visualize.
* add some comments to Camera3dModel
  In particular, a search for checkerboard should really turn up this
  important piece of code
* fix test build/warning issues on 18.04
* Merge pull request `#50 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/50>`_ from guilhermelawless/tf-buffer-member
  Make TF buffer a class member
* make TF buffer a class member
  Fixes `#48 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/48>`_. Sleeping to wait for TFs is no longer needed and was removed.
* Merge pull request `#47 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/47>`_ from guilhermelawless/fix-checkerboard-visualization
  Fix checkerboard visualization
* Merge pull request `#45 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/45>`_ from guilhermelawless/kinetic-devel
  Allow some time to get TFs in plane_finder
* fix checkerboard visualization msg
* allow some time to get TFs in plane_finder
* add a second error block test, that actually needs to converge
